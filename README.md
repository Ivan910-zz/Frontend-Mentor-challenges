* First time trying to make a page like this, using everything that I learned in the past 2 months.There are some mistakes, not correct pathing to some images, not going for mobile first approach etc. For my next project I will try to fix all the mistakes that I made trying to build this site.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Bonus, i have also created FAQ and Contact page.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I have learned how to scroll back to TOP (without using any JS) of the page using LOGO inside the footer, when clicked on the LOGO it goes back to TOP of the page, bonus i have found that you can use "scroll-behavior: smooth;" for better transition from bottom to top.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp)
- Both websites have great examples of everything you need.
